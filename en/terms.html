                <h1>OpenFlat Auto-Renewal Terms</h1>
                <p>Welcome to OpenFlat.</p>
                <p>By clicking “Subscribe”, enabling “Auto-Renewal”, or using the auto-renewal feature for any OpenFlat paid service, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to these Auto-Renewal Terms (“Terms”).</p>
                <p>Unless you cancel auto-renewal before the end of the current billing period, we will automatically charge the next subscription fee and extend your service accordingly.</p>

                <h2>1. Relationship to Other Agreements</h2>
                <p>These Auto-Renewal Terms form a supplementary agreement to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The OpenFlat Service Agreement</li>
                    <li>The OpenFlat Purchase Rules (https://openflat.tech/rules.html)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These documents together constitute a unified agreement. In case of any inconsistency, these Auto-Renewal Terms shall prevail with respect to auto-renewal matters.</p>

                <h2>2. What Is Auto-Renewal</h2>
                <p>Auto-renewal is a subscription mechanism that allows your OpenFlat paid service to automatically renew at the end of each billing period.</p>
                <p>If you enable auto-renewal and do not cancel it before the renewal date, you authorize OpenFlat (or the applicable payment provider) to charge the subscription fee for the next billing cycle and extend your service validity accordingly.</p>

                <h2>3. Billing Cycles</h2>
                <p>Available billing cycles may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monthly</li>
                    <li>Quarterly</li>
                    <li>Annual</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The specific billing cycle and price applicable to you are shown on the purchase page at the time of subscription.</p>

                <h2>4. Automatic Charging Rules</h2>
                <h3>4.1 Authorization to Charge</h3>
                <p>By enabling auto-renewal, you authorize OpenFlat and/or the relevant payment service provider to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Automatically charge the subscription fee for the next billing cycle;</li>
                    <li>Deduct the applicable amount from your selected payment method;</li>
                    <li>Do so without requiring additional password, SMS verification, or repeated confirmation (unless required by law or the payment provider).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4.2 Third-Party Payment Methods</h3>
                <p>Auto-renewal charges depend on the payment method you selected:</p>

                <p><strong>(1) WeChat Pay / Alipay / Bank Card / Other Online Payment Methods</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The charge will be attempted on the subscription expiration date.</li>
                    <li>If the payment fails (e.g., insufficient balance, expired card, payment limits), we may retry within a reasonable period.</li>
                    <li>If payment continues to fail, auto-renewal will be terminated and your service will expire at the end of the current billing period.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>(2) Apple In-App Purchase (IAP)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you subscribed through Apple, billing and renewal are governed by Apple’s subscription rules.</li>
                    <li>Apple will charge your Apple ID account on the renewal date.</li>
                    <li>If payment fails, Apple may enter its official retry period.</li>
                    <li>If payment is not successfully completed during Apple’s retry period, the subscription will lapse.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To manage Apple subscriptions:</p>
                <p>iOS Device → Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions → OpenFlat → Cancel Subscription</p>

                <h3>4.3 Account Responsibility</h3>
                <p>You are responsible for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintaining valid payment information;</li>
                    <li>Ensuring sufficient balance or credit;</li>
                    <li>Keeping your payment method active and up to date.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>OpenFlat is not liable for service interruption caused by payment failures due to account issues.</p>

                <h3>4.4 Third-Party Terms</h3>
                <p>If you use a third-party payment provider, you are also subject to that provider’s terms and conditions.</p>

                <h2>5. Cancellation of Auto-Renewal</h2>
                <p>You may cancel auto-renewal at any time.</p>

                </ul>

                <h3>5.2 Apple Subscription Cancellation</h3>

                <p>iOS Device → Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions → OpenFlat → Cancel</p>

                <h3>5.3 Cancellation Timing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Changes to auto-renewal status may not be immediate.</li>
                    <li>Any renewal instruction already submitted before cancellation becomes effective may still be processed.</li>
                    <li>Fees already charged are generally non-refundable unless otherwise required by applicable law.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>We will notify you through reasonable means (e.g., email or in-app notice).</li>
                    <li>If you do not agree to the new price, you may cancel auto-renewal before the next renewal date.</li>
                    <li>If you do not cancel, the renewed subscription will be charged at the updated price.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>8. Termination of Auto-Renewal Service</h2>
